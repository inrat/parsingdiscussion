# parsingdiscussion
A project made with Java that parses the source code of a discussion forum into a xlsx-file. 
Created for a person that needed to analyze the discussion data from ylilauta.org.
The project is pretty messy compared using API, but I decided at the time to execute it with my existing knowledge.
